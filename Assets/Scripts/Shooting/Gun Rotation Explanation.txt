The variables:

var rotSpeed : float = 15;
The speed at which we shall rotate our gun.

var thisRotation : float = 0;
The amount our gun has already rotated. This is important 
because we need to restrict how far we can rotate our gun.

Code chunks:

if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W)) {
If the W key is being held down.

if(thisRotation > -11) {
If thisRotation is greater than -11.

transform.Rotate(Vector3(rotSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0, 0));
Rotate the gun downward at the speed of rotSpeed every second.

thisRotation -= rotSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
Subtract thisRotation by rotSpeed every second, to make sure we can stop the rotation when needed.

if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S)) {
If the S key is being held down.

if(thisRotation < 89) {
Of thosRptatopm os less tham 89.

transform.Rotate(Vector3(-rotSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0, 0));
Rotate the gun upward at the speed of rotSpeed every second.

thisRotation += rotSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
Add rotSpeed to thisRotation every second.
