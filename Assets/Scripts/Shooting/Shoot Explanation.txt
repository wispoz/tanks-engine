Variables:

var tankShell : GameObject;
This variable is the game object we shoot.

var boomNoise : AudioClip; 
This is the sound we play when we fire.

var timer : float = 1; 
This is the timer that has to reach timerMax before we can shoot. It is set at 1 at default so we can shoot right away.

var timerMax : float = 1; 
This is the time it takes to reload.

var powerOfShot : float = 30; 
This is how fast the projectile will be shot. I recommend this speed for realism, but it sure is fun to play around with ;).


Custom functions:

shootProjectile()
This is our custom function that shoots the projectile when we call it.

Code Chunks:

timer += 1 * Time.deltaTime;
Every second, the timer variable has a value of +1 every second.

if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space)) {
While space is held down.

if(timer >= timerMax) {
If timer is greater than or equal to timerMax.

shootProjectile();
This goes to our shootProjectile function that we made for this script.

timer = 0;
Sets the timer variable to 0.

var shellInstance = Instantiate(tankShell, transform.position, transform.rotation);
Creates an instance of the tankShell variable, at the position and rotation of the object with this script.

audio.PlayOneShot(boomNoise);
Plays the noise held in the boomNoise variable.

shellInstance.rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(Vector3.forward * powerOfShot, ForceMode.Impulse);
Gives the last created shell instance a force of powerOfShot, once.
