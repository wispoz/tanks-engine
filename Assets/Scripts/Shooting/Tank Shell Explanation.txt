Variables

var lifeTimer : float = 0.0; 
The variable to tell us how long this shell has been alive.

var lifeTimerMax : float = 12.0;
The max amount of time this shell is allowed to live. 

var explosionRadius : float = 5.0;
The radious of the full effect of the explosion.

var explosionPower : float = 350.0; 
The full power of the explosion.

var explosion : GameObject;
The particle system which replaces this object once we hit something.

custom functions:

explosionThing()
The custom function that is used when we want our projectile to explode.

code chunks:

var thisDirection : Vector3 = transform.position + transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward);
Makes a new variable, or sets it if it is already existant. This variable will be the direction of
the shell, which lets us give it a proper projectile arc.

rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition(Vector3.up * -9.81, thisDirection);
This adds a force to the projectil at the position, of thisDirection, allowing us to make it rotate towards the ground
while making it move to the ground at the speed of gravity. 

lifeTimer += 1 * Time.deltaTime;
Adds 1 to the lifeTimer variable every bloody feking second.

if(lifeTimer >= lifeTimerMax) {
If lifeTimer is greater than or equal to lifeTimerMax.

Destroy (gameObject);
Destroy this Game Object.

explosionThing();
Go to our custom function explosionThing.

var explosionInstantiation = Instantiate(explosion, this.transform.position, this.transform.rotation);
Instantiates an instance of our explosion particle system at the position of this projectile with its rotation.

Destroy (gameObject);
Destroy this game object.

var colliders : Collider[] = Physics.OverlapSphere (transform.position, explosionRadius);
Makes a collider which is with the radious of the explosionRadious variable.

for (var hit in colliders) {
For everything this collider hits.

if (hit.rigidbody)  { 
If an object the collider hit is a rigidbody.

hit.rigidbody.AddExplosionForce(explosionPower, transform.position, explosionRadius);
Make an explosion that effects the rigidbody it hits with full force, and effects a lot of 
rigidbody withing a big radious.
